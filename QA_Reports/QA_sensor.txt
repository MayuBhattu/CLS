Quality Assurance Report
Sensor.py


QA requested by: Anant Joshi
Date:        5/10/2018
Reviewer: Riya
Permanent links:        1.https://github.com/anantjoshi97/Advitiy-Control-Model/blob/master/satellite.py 


QA suggestions:
1. Add the convention of sunsensor in comment (i.e. S1 and S2 are sunsensors opposite to each-other)
2. Run code yourself once to check for compilation error.
3. Line 1 - constants_1U
4. Line 4 - nultivariate_normal is imported but never used
5. Line 13 - instead of declaring SS_Quantizier as constant declare u as constant (algebra of obtaining u from SS_Quantizier not known by sensor modeller and even not expected - value should be supplied by sensor hardware person)
6. Test cases for ADC were not correct
7. One test-case for calc_SV is wrong.
8. Line 23 - declare it as 1D array else get syntax error in line 45
9. Line 29 - use round instead of int because numerical errors will cause the result to deviate by large amount
10. Line 31 -         v_output[iter] = v
11. Line 32 - error should not be constant
12. Line 87 - input vector should be in inertial frame
13. Line 94 - It should be v_sun_b_m
14. Line 107-109 - Errors should not be taken as constant 
15. Line 107-108 - v_pos and v_vel instead of pos and vel
16. Line 119 - input vector should be in inertial frame
17. MAG_BIAS should not be declared as constant. It should be random noise. 
18. In gyroscope modelling, random noise is not include. What about Piyush code?

QA suggestions:
1. Declare u in constants and give a good explanation in CLS manual
2. Declare m_normalvectors in constants itself, to save time
3.  Give complete explanation of line 30 in either code or manual (and if in manual refer to manual in code)
4. Keep the return in line 78 under the if in line 70
5. Test code failed


QA implementations:
1. 5 - Please read the instruction of running in the test-code. (in the starting of code, after import of files)
2. All other suggestions have been implemented
