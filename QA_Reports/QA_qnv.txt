QA Report of qnv.py
May 19, 2018
Code written by: Anant Joshi
QA performed by: Riya
Changes made:
• Removed dot and cross function because no need for row vectors.
• Instead of single quatMultiplty declared two functions quatMultiplynorm
and quatMultiplyUnnorm because when we want to rotate a vector by
multiplying it with quaternion its magnitude should not change.
• In quatRotate
– added a line which checks if a vector is null vector and if condition
is true it simply returns the null vector.
– replaced 2 lines of code (which were used for calculating inverse of
quaternion) with quatInv().
• Corrected the error in sign in formula used in quatDer1.
• Removed quatDer2, skew and theta2J as not needed.
• In rotm2quat
– changed convention of quaternion numbering from 1 to 4 to 0 to 3
because the latter convention is followed in quat2rotm and the book.
– corrected the error in sign in formula used.
• In quat2rotm multiplied M1 with 2 and M2 with -1 so that it matches
with the given formula.
• Added comments for better understanding of what a function is doing.

QA suggestions:
1. Change omega1 to v_omega to show data type
2. Change W_vector to v_qv_dot
3. Change W_scalar to qs_dot
4. “omega1 = v_q_BI_b + R*v_q_BO_b” is wrong. The right hand side contains quaternions according to the v_q prefix and left hand side has angular velocity. 
5. If the input to the function is correct, the function will return correct output.
